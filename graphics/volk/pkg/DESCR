volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan. It allows you to dynamically load entrypoints
required to use Vulkan without linking to vulkan-1.dll or statically linking
Vulkan loader. Additionally, volk simplifies the use of Vulkan extensions by
automatically loading all associated entrypoints. Finally, volk enables loading
Vulkan entrypoints directly from the driver which can increase performance by
skipping loader dispatch overhead.
